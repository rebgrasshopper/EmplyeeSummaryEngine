## Introduction:

This project is a simple tool running in Node.js, designed to be able to gather information about a team consisting of managers, engineers, and interns, and display that information in an HTML page. It uses Inquirer to query the user for information, and stores employee data in an employee json file, reading it and render applicable employees to a team page. The program can add and remove employees, and re-render a page without changes. It stores all of the files generated in an output folder.

## Installation:

To install this project, download the source files from github, and access the folder via your terminal/console of choice. Run npm i to install dependancies (Inquirer), and run node index.js to start the tool.
